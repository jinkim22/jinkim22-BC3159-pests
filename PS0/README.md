# COMS BC 3159 - SP23
# PS0: Math and Coding Background and Environment
* Due: 11:59pm Wednesday, January 25th

## Submission Information

**This year for submission we are using Gradescope - you must submit to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/489410) to get credit!** Gradecope will allow for infinite submissions until the deadline and then will start marking submissions as late and will then lock 2 days after the due date. Please make sure to mark the page for each question on the written via Gradescope and only upload the requested files for the code section. Also if you are having issues with autograders make sure you didn't rename files! Submissions not following the requirements *will not be graded* so make sure to ask quesitons before the deadline (but we'll try to be nice for PS0).

Good luck!

## Written Assignment (10 points)

Please go to the PDF in the `written` folder for the written instructions (also available on Gradescope). Please use the provided latex template to write up your solutions and *submit the pdf output from latex to Gradescope*. Please refer to the software install guide for more information on Latex.

## Coding Assignment (10 points)

Please read the README.md in the `singlecell` folder for instructions for the coding assignment. You will also submit this to gradescope. As mentioned in class, I am going to try to put together an autograder, but if not we'll just ask you to upload the `util.h` file and we'll manually grade it.
